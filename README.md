This is a single page application featuring a number of hospitals in Bangalore, India. This application offers functionality such as displaying map markers to identify the locations, a search function to easily discover the location and a listview to support simple browsing of all locations.  

## Implementation

* The JavaScript libraries used are Knockout and jQuery.  
* Knockout JS library was used to implement the search and the list functionality of locations.
